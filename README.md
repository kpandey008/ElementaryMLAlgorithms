# ElementaryMLAlgorithms
This repository is a collection of standard ML algorithms implemented in Python, NumPy.

# Algorithms implemented
1) Linear Regression (Least squares, L2, LASSO)
2) Kernel Perceptron for Classification
3) Active learning strategy applied on the Boston Housing prices dataset
4) K-Means Clustering on synthetically generated dataset(for visualiazation purposes).
5) Gaussian Mixture Models on synthetically generated data using Sci-Kit learn.

# Note
The algorithms have been implemented as a way to explain the core logic.
Various standard libraries are available to implement these algorithms and should be preferred.
