# ElementaryMLAlgorithms
This repository is a collection of standard ML algorithms implemented in Python, NumPy.

# Algorithms implemented
1) Linear Regression (Least squares, L2, LASSO)
2) Kernel Perceptron for Classification
3) Active learning strategy applied on the Boston Housing prices dataset
4) K-Means Clustering on synthetically generated dataset(for visualiazation purposes).
5) Gaussian Mixture Models on synthetically generated data using Sci-Kit learn.

# Folder structure
I have organised the folder structure of the code as follows:-
1) The folder name specifies the algorithm name
2) Inside the folder there are generally two files: client.py and <algorithm_name>.py
3) client.py usually involves the preprocessing steps like
   a) Feature extraction and scaling
   b) utilising the custom class of the learning algorithm implemented 
   c) Visualizing important information
4) <algorithm_name>.py is the core implementation of the learning algorithm

# Note
The algorithms have been implemented as a way to explain the core logic.
Various standard libraries are available to implement these algorithms and should be preferred.
